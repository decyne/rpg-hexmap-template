Programatically compiles hex description files into a PDF document

Add hex descriptions to the hexes directory, following the template file hexes/template.yml.

Once hex description files have been created, you will need to add the files to the list of hexes to be included. Add the filename of the added hex description to the included_hexes.yml file. The order they are included in the included_hexes.yml file is their key number and the order they will be listed in the final document.

By default the main document requires the LaTeX [rpg-module](https://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=87&t=73823).
